                            Now that i know you do, let me tell you how i got to like you,
                            and i promise i am not trying to love bomb you or anything so 
                            like please dont ghost me after this. Anywho Do you remember the 
                            night that you asked me if i wanted to play cards and we did, that
                            night you kept laughing and smiling and you were soo charming, i
                            was soo in awe of you in that moment but when i went back to my
                            room it hit me how i was crushing so hard over someone i met 3 days
                            ago, i almost screamed cause i simply couldnâ€™t bear how adorable you
                            were and like then you asked me to be your girlfriend, i was over the
                            moon. In conclusion i just wanna say i am grateful that i met you and
                            i really really really hope we can work this out.
                            Love, zi.
